 This was lovingly made by Victor K. Chan, AKA TippyTappyFingers.

 Rules:
 You start off with 50 food, 10 civilians, 10 iron, 50 stone, and 100 wood.
 - A normal civilian will consume 1 food every turn.
 - Every turn, you can:
   => Build
   => Trade (if you have a Market built and have the skill 'Marketing I' or higher)
   => Attack (if you have a Barracks built, soldiers, and a target to attack)
   => Defend (if you have soldiers and your wall is still intact)
   => Gather Resources (if you have civilians to do so)
 - You can build a large number of constructs, if you have a high enough Town Hall level (and have researched them, in specific cases)
 - Trading is a good method to getting your hands on materials that are hard to come by!
 - Attacking a monster or a village will give FIGHTING EXP and materials for your city!
 - Defending your city is necessary to ensure survival!
 - Gathering Resources grants GATHERING EXP to your city, letting them upgrade their skills!
 - Sometimes, you may be prompted to make a decision. Picking the right ones will help your city thrive!
