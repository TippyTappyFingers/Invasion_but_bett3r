# This was lovingly made by Victor K. Chan, AKA TippyTappyFingers.
#
# Rules:
# You start off with 50 food, 10 civilians, 10 iron, 50 stone, and 100 wood.
# - A normal civilian will consume 1 food every turn.
# - Every turn, you can:
#   => Build
#   => Trade (if you have a Market built and have the skill 'Marketing I' or higher)
#   => Attack (if you have a Barracks built, soldiers, and a target to attack)
#   => Defend (if you have soldiers and your wall is still intact)
#   => Gather Resources (if you have civilians to do so)
# - You can build a large number of constructs, if you have a high enough
#   Town Hall level (and have researched them, in specific cases)
